Altman Z-Score Analyzer: A financial tool by Prof. Edward Altman, it assesses a company's bankruptcy risk using key ratios. Scores categorize firms into safe, grey, or distress zones, aiding quick risk evaluation for investors and creditors.

Key components of the Altman Z-Score include:

Working Capital/Total Assets Ratio: This ratio assesses a company's ability to cover short-term obligations with its assets.

Retained Earnings/Total Assets Ratio: It reflects the proportion of total assets financed by the company's earnings, indicating its capacity to reinvest in the business.

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)/Total Assets Ratio: This ratio measures the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets.

Market Value of Equity/Book Value of Total Liabilities Ratio: It assesses the market's valuation of a company's equity relative to its debt.

Revenue/Total Assets Ratio: This ratio evaluates how efficiently a company utilizes its assets to generate revenue.

The Altman Z-Score categorizes companies into different zones:

Safe Zone: A Z-Score above a certain threshold indicates financial stability, suggesting a low risk of bankruptcy.

Grey Zone: Scores within a specified range indicate a moderate risk, and further analysis is recommended.

Distress Zone: A Z-Score below a critical level signals financial distress and an increased risk of bankruptcy.

The Altman Z-Score Analyzer is widely used by analysts, investors, and creditors as a tool for financial risk assessment and decision-making. It provides valuable insights into a company's financial health, allowing stakeholders to make informed judgments about its creditworthiness and overall stability.
